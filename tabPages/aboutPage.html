    <p>Breaking VAD is an engineering design team at Rice University. Their project, as part of the 2016-2017 Capstone Design course, was to develop tools for a simulation-based training to help medical professionals respond to complications arising in LVAD patients. The Simulated Pediatric LVAD Training System was developed in partnership with Texas Children's Hospital.</p>
    <p><b>Mission Statement:</b> Through collaboration with Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital, our team will design a pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) simulation that will improve the quality of training available to Health Professionals.</p>
