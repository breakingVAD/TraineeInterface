    <p>The Simulated Pediatric LVAD Training System is a system designed to help cardiologists train their
    teams to respond quickly and effectively to high risk situations with pediatric LVAD patients. The system includes
    a Mock LVAD Display (which can be seen by trainees and controlled by instructors) and a Mock Echocardiogram, which
    allows trainees to practice diagnosing and responding to complications in LVAD patients.</p>

    <p>The Mock LVAD Display is accessed and controlled through this website. To start a session, an instructor would
    log in to his or her instructor account, bringing them to the Instructor Interface. The Instructor Interface allows
    users to change values displayed on the main page of the Mock LVAD Display, add alarms to the Mock LVAD Display's
    alarm log, and trigger active alarms. Once the instructor is logged in, trainees can use the instructor's email
    address to join their session. The trainees will be able to see the Mock LVAD Display being controlled by the
    instructor.</p>

    <p>The Mock Echocardiogram component of this system requires our echocardiogram simulation hardware. This consists
    of a sensor pad (to be placed on a patient manikin's chest) and a mock echocardiogram probe, both of which plug into
    a small box of electronics, which then plugs into a computer via USB. The computer connected to the hardware must
    run an application which can be downloaded from the Instructor Interface. That application will allow users to
    calibrate the correct positions from which to view different angles of the heart using the Mock Echocardiogram and
    send data about the echocariogram probe's position to the website. From the Mock LVAD Display, trainees can navigate
    to a Mock Echocardiogram page which allows them to see the Mock Echocardiogram Display. From the Instructor
    Interface, instructors can upload echocardiogram images, or choose from existing ones, for different views of the
    heart, which will be displayed appropriately on the Mock Echocardiogram Display.</p>
